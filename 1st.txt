Task:
Given a column name and its description, classify the column into one of the following labels:
	•	PII – if the column contains, is likely to contain, or could reasonably contain any form of personally identifiable information.
	•	Not PII – if the column clearly cannot contain any personally identifiable information.
	•	Unknown – if the column name and description provide insufficient information to determine whether it contains PII.

Strictness Rules
	1.	Be conservative:
If there is any reasonable possibility that the column includes personal information, mark it as PII.
	2.	Give “Unknown” only if:
	•	The name and description are too vague,
	•	OR they do not hint toward either PII or non-PII content.
	3.	Do NOT guess “Not PII” unless:
	•	You are confident that the column cannot contain personal data
(e.g., “Transaction Amount”, “Product ID”, “Timestamp”).
	4.	Consider both:
	•	Direct identifiers (name, phone, email, etc.)
	•	Indirect identifiers (employee ID, customer code, account reference, etc.)
→ If they tie to an individual, still mark PII.
