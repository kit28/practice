Subject: Call Quality Application – Production Enhancements and Timeline

Dear All,

We have successfully deployed both the frontend and backend components of the Call Quality application to the production server. During the final review prior to client handover, we identified a few functional limitations that merit attention:
	1.	The current application is a replica of the live demo version. At present, a user can upload a folder, execute the pipeline, and download the results upon completion.
	2.	If the same user logs in again, there is no provision to view or download results from previous executions.

After internal discussions, we propose to address these gaps through the following enhancements, along with the associated timelines:

Backend Enhancements (7 working days):
	1.	Implementation of a scheduler to control pipeline execution on uploaded files, including the ability to run and stop the pipeline within a predefined time window, and to process only newly uploaded files.
	2.	User-specific pipeline execution and result management, enabling segregation and retrieval of results based on individual users.

Frontend Enhancements (7 working days):
	1.	Development of a user-facing table to display uploaded documents.
	2.	A dedicated view to track the status of previous pipeline executions.
	3.	Functionality to download results from past executions.

These points are being highlighted for your review and approval. Please let us know if we should proceed with the above scope and timelines.

Kind regards,
[Your Name]



Task:
Given a column name and its description, classify the column into one of the following labels:
	•	PII – if the column contains, is likely to contain, or could reasonably contain any form of personally identifiable information.
	•	Not PII – if the column clearly cannot contain any personally identifiable information.
	•	Unknown – if the column name and description provide insufficient information to determine whether it contains PII.

⸻

Strictness Rules
	1.	Be conservative:
If there is any reasonable possibility that the column includes personal information, mark it as PII.
	2.	Give “Unknown” only if:
	•	The name and description are too vague,
	•	OR they do not hint toward either PII or non-PII content.
	3.	Do NOT guess “Not PII” unless:
	•	You are confident that the column cannot contain personal data
(e.g., “Transaction Amount”, “Product ID”, “Timestamp”).
	4.	Consider both:
	•	Direct identifiers (name, phone, email, etc.)
	•	Indirect identifiers (employee ID, customer code, account reference, etc.)
→ If they tie to an individual, still mark PII.
