We have executed our pipeline for Phase-2 focusing on the ‘Red Flag’ quality standard questions. As part of this, we would appreciate your insights on the following two questions:
	1.	The agent did not serve the customer
	2.	The agent’s attitude was unacceptable

Specifically, we would like to understand the evaluation criteria currently being used for these questions. Could you please share the parameters or guidelines followed during assessment?

Looking forward to your response.
