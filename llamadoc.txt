Documentation: Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct AWQ INT4

1. Model Overview

The Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct AWQ INT4 is a compressed, production-optimized version of Meta’s Llama 3.1 model series.
It contains 8 billion parameters and is instruction-tuned, meaning it is fine-tuned specifically to follow user instructions accurately across a wide range of tasks (chatting, answering, summarizing, coding, etc.).

This version uses AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) and INT4 (4-bit integer precision) to make the model lighter and faster without significant loss of quality.

Model Size:
	•	Original FP16 (full precision) size: ~16 GB
	•	After INT4 quantization: ~4.5 GB

Parameter Count:
	•	8 billion parameters

2. What is AWQ INT4?
	•	AWQ (Activation-aware Weight Quantization) is an advanced compression technique that intelligently rescales important weight channels based on activation sensitivity.
It preserves critical weights’ precision while heavily compressing less critical parts, minimizing the typical quality drop seen in basic quantization.
	•	INT4 (4-bit integers) means model weights are stored using only 4 bits per value, drastically reducing model size and computation overhead compared to standard 16-bit (FP16) or 32-bit (FP32) formats.

Combining AWQ and INT4 results in:
	•	Up to 75%-80% smaller memory footprint.
	•	2x-4x faster inference speeds.
	•	Minimal loss in model accuracy.

3. Key Benefits
	•	Reduced Latency: Faster output generation.
	•	Lower Memory Usage: Smaller deployment size, higher batch processing possible.
	•	Cost Efficiency: Lower GPU memory and computation cost.
	•	Production-Ready: Stable, reliable outputs even after quantization.

4. Recommended Use Cases
	•	Customer service chatbots and virtual assistants.
	•	Text generation, summarization, and rewriting.
	•	Knowledge search, document retrieval.
	•	Running on GPUs with limited VRAM (like 8GB–16GB) or on edge devices.
