Subject: Verint API Integration – Update and Clarifications Required

Hello Bony and Varun,

Tushar and I had a discussion regarding the Verint API integration, and we have summarised our current understanding below:
	1.	As per Paul from the Verint team, there is no bulk media download API available. We will be required to download audio files individually.
	2.	The available API is currently in the Production environment, which we cannot access for testing. The Verint team is working on setting up a UAT environment, which is expected to be ready only after January. Once available, they will upload some dummy audio calls for our testing, and we will require access to this UAT environment to begin validation.
	3.	The expected daily call volume for download is 2,000. We would like to confirm whether this number is final or subject to change as we progress.
	4.	The EA team will finalise the integration approach and guide us on the interim steps, given that the UAT environment is not yet available.
	5.	We need clarification on whether the audio files will be stored within our environment or streamed/replayed directly via the API for processing. If storage on our side is required, we need alignment on where these files will be maintained.

Kindly review these points and let us know if we have missed anything or misunderstood any aspect.

We have a WG meeting tomorrow where we need to provide updates to the Call Quality WG team and to Sanjib. Your feedback would be greatly appreciated.
