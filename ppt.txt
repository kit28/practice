Slide Title: Call Center Analytics – Automating Agent Performance Evaluation
________________________________________
1. Problem Statement
At SAB Bank, customers contact the support center via phone for help with queries or issues. A small internal QA team manually reviews recorded customer-agent conversations to assess agent performance based on key soft-skill metrics:
•	Responsiveness

•	Empathy

•	Accountability

•	Connectedness
However, this process is: - Time-consuming and labor-intensive - Inconsistent due to subjective human interpretation - Limited in scale and scope

2. Solution Overview
To overcome the limitations of manual evaluation, we have developed an AI-powered pipeline that automates the entire process, ensuring faster, unbiased, and consistent analysis.
How It Works:
1.	Input Audio: System accepts call recordings in WAV format (supports both Arabic and English).
2.	Speech-to-Text Transcription: A state-of-the-art speech-to-text model transcribes the audio into text.
3.	Speaker Diarization: Diarization segments the transcript and labels speakers (agent vs. customer) accurately.
4.	LLM-Based Evaluation: A large language model (LLM) analyses the agent’s part of the conversation using predefined soft-skill metrics, generating both scores and reasoning.
5.	Output Report: A structured report is generated for each call, detailing agent performance and rationale behind each metric.
This solution is modular, scalable, and can be integrated into SAB’s quality assurance workflow.
