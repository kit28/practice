Subject: Request for Additional Red Flag Evaluated Samples – Phase 2

Dear Hussain and Ridah,

As discussed in our previous CC Analytics Working Group meeting, we are now proceeding with Phase 2, focusing on the red flag contact center quality standard questions.

In the earlier set of 50 samples shared with us, only one file contained evaluations based on the red flag quality standards—the rest appeared to be empty. Please refer to the attached file for your reference.

To support the development process, we would appreciate it if you could share additional samples that have been evaluated specifically on the red flag questions.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
