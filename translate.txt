Hi, I need some help with my credit card.
Sure, I'd be happy to assist you. Can you tell me what's the issue?
I noticed an unknown charge on my bill this month.
Let me pull up your account details. Could you verify your full name and last four digits of the card?
It's John Matthews, card ending in 4572.
Thanks. I see the charge — it looks like it’s from a merchant called TravelGo. Do you recognize it?
No, I’ve never used that service.
Okay, I’ll raise a dispute request for you.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome!
